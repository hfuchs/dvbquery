DVB query
=========

NEWS: See tag messages (git tag -n).
TODO: See source code (grep TODO dvb).

Project Cycle
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Hosted on Github.  Checkout a local repository, branch and then publish
branch and tags:

    git clone git@github.com:hfuchs/dvbquery.git
    git branch [featureX]
    [work, commit]
    git push origin [featureX] --tags

On releases do (TODO Any reason not to use the Makefile?):

    su
    cp dvb /usr/local/bin/
    chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/dvb
    [test with examples from `dvb -h`]
    [write announcement]

Motivation & Misc Docs
----------------------------------------------------------------------

2009-12-13, Started.  Motivation: Providing fast access to the DVB
timetable information by scraping the website.

2010-01-22, Downloaded one of the DVB widgets (see reference/
directory).  There's a special server which handles these requests
without my having to parse tons of XML hell.  The *.gadget files inside
the officially downloadable zip are in turn just zip archives.

2011-03-28, The fuck?  Over one year?  Cleaned up (now with Makefileâ„¢)
and added embarrasing abbreviations facility.
