Motivation & Misc Docs

2009-12-13, Started.  Motivation: Providing fast access to the DVB
timetable information by scraping the website.

2010-01-22, Downloaded one of the DVB widgets (see reference/
directory).  There's a special server which handles these requests
without my having to parse tons of XML hell.  The *.gadget files inside
the officially downloadable zip are in turn just zip archives.

2011-03-28, The fuck?  Over one year?  Cleaned up (now with Makefile™)
and added embarrasing abbreviations facility.
