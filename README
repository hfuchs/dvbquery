Motivation & Misc Docs
----------------------------------------------------------------------

2009-12-13, Started.  Motivation: Providing fast access to the DVB
timetable information by scraping the website.

2010-01-22, Downloaded one of the DVB widgets.  There's a special server which
handles these requests without my having to parse tons of XML hell.  The
*.gadget files inside the officially downloadable zip are in turn just zip
archives.
